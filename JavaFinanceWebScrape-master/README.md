Basic java webscraping program using Maven

This program scrapes yahoo finance for basic financial information.
It will scrape the company name and the price given the ticker symbol.

The program uses an array to which tickers are put into and then the program will
iterate over each symbol to scrape yahoo finance for the information.


--To do--
There is a sample stocks.txt file to which I will add support for file reading and 
putting stock tickers into that file for the program to read.

Will add more data scraping for more stock info.
